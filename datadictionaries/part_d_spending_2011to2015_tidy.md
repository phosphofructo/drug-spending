## Important notes

### Data provenance
Drug information comes from Part D Prescription Drug Event (PDE) data and is available for a subset (~70%) of Medicare beneficiaries.

PDE records were summarized by drug by linking National Drug Codes (NDCs), which are available in the PDE data, to the First Databank MedKnowledgeâ„¢ database and aggregating by brand name and generic name.

### Data sources and calculation methods
Spending amounts are calculated based on the gross drug cost, which represents total spending for the prescription claim, including Medicare, plan, and beneficiary payments.

Data from all Part D organization and plan types were included in the analysis.

Data were aggregated across all strengths, dosage forms, and routes of administration.

### Excluded data
Over-the-counter drugs are excluded from this data set.

To protect the privacy of Medicare beneficiaries, all drug records derived from 10 or fewer claims -- as well as records that can be used to calculate such data -- are also excluded.
